# AirfieldManifest
We are running an airfield manifesto, trying to implement a system that will help decision makers see how much money is actually wasted.

<p> Suppose that the plane is taking off and the experience of the pilot allows us to understand how competently the fuel will be used. Someone will do the same task for a contagious time, and we are not talking about seconds, but about 10 minutes that are solved in this work. Let's draw a hyperbola, depict the axes time & fuel & distance. The depicted hyperbole is nothing more than the path of the aircraft until the passengers are thrown off and descend. </p>

<p> Let's do some research, it's easier to talk about how they fly. It can be seen from two studies that the first time the pilot flew better and took less time - hence the fuel. And considering the second option - the pilot landed late, therefore, having spent more fuel, having flown extremely unsuccessfully </p>
<p> Let's display the result on a regular two-dimensional graph, where the x-axis is each pilot individually, and the other axis is responsible for the distance between these events. </p>
